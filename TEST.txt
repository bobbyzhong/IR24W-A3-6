the queries we experiment 
1. machine learning
    originally the top result is a text file, after add pagerank, the result has more link
2. computer science
3. software engineering 
4. virtual reality
5. acm
6. lkjsfaasdnasd (we want to see what is search engine's response to meaningless string)
7.  (handle empty query)
8. how hard is it to change to computer science 
    (our search engine need a long time to handle long query,therefore we shorten the number of url for comparison)
    our search engine also don't have the ability to process natural language query well 
9. engineering software 
    we don't have the time to implement the position of token in a document
10. ics 
    without pagerank: 
    type your query here: ics
    https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/pubs.ff
    https://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/wq99_syllabus.html#computing
    https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/all.html
    https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/sao/Course_updates.php
    https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/sao/Course_updates

    with pagerank: 
    type your query here: ics
    https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/
    https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/pubs.ff

    https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/all.html


11. informatic and computer science 
    (and introduce many useless page, we just ignore the stop word in query)
    (however a better way would be recognize the boolean expression in query, however we don't have time to implement that)
12. hardest cs class
13. 2023 ics course schedule
14. graduation requirement 
15. back propagation algorithm 
16. ics student council 
17. ics ics ics ics ics ics
18. ics open lab 
19. 121 information retrieval 
20. brandywine 
    (this should be outside of ics content)
    retrun empty
